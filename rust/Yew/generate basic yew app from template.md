# generate basic yew app from template 

## Info 

Here we are using cargo-generate and along with the template that is provided from the yew getting started documentation.


```zsh 
cargo generate --git https://github.com/yewstack/yew-trunk-minimal-template
```
Please note that we are going to run this in our project directory, this will initialize a brand new cargo package aswell and prompt you to enter the name.

Here we chose to go with the name **first-front-end**.
