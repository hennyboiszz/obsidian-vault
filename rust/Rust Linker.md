#rust 

When installing rust we are going to need a **linker** which a program that rust uses to join its compiled outputs into one file.

Most likely we are already going to have a linker already installed but if we begin to start to get linker errors we should **install a C compiler** 

On Mac we can do this by running the follow command in our terminal 

```zsh 
$ xcode-select --install
```
