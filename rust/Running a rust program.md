The way that we run a rust program is by first compiling it by running the following commands in our shell

```zsh
$ rustc <filename>
or 
$ rustc main.rs
```
In order to run our program we will then do 

```zsh 
$ ./main
```
Outputting "Hello World" for ex

In rust we first have to compile and then we have to run it, compiling and executing code are two differing things.
